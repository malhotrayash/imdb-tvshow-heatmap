# 🎬 IMDb TV Show Heatmap

An interactive visualization of episode ratings across all seasons of a TV show, displayed as a heatmap.

## 🚀 About the Project
This project was built with **React + Vite** and styled using simple CSS. It uses the **TVmaze API** to fetch TV show and episode data, and currently displays ratings from TVmaze.  
In the future, this will be linked with **IMDb ratings** for more accurate results.

## 🖥️ How It Works
- Search for any TV show by name.  
- The app fetches all episodes, grouped by season.  
- Each episode’s rating is shown in a **color-coded heatmap**:
  - Higher ratings → darker / richer colors  
  - Lower ratings → lighter colors  

This makes it easy to spot trends, highlight fan-favorite episodes, or identify weaker seasons at a glance.

## 📌 Use Cases
- Quickly compare seasons of your favorite TV shows.  
- Explore how audience reception changes over time.  
- Great for fans, data nerds, or anyone curious about TV history.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Replace TVmaze ratings with **IMDb episode ratings** for better accuracy.  
- Add export / share options.  
- Support more data visualizations beyond heatmaps.
